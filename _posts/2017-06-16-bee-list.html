<h2>Day One: In Which, We Meet the Bees!</h2>
<hr class="clean">
  <p>On June 1st, we got our first look at our hives.</p>
  <p>When we arrived, the previous owner of the hives was ready for us. Or, he thought he was. His introduction to the new Master to his hives, was a purple haired girl with big glasses, in a straw hat.</p>
  <p>The girl was me, I am not an obvious bee keeper, I'm small and silly, but I love bees. I love them so much.</p>

  <p>There is something about those faces and those fuzzy little insects that just makes my whole world implode in joy. It is a known fact, that if someone even gives me an opening, you are not leaving without as many bee stories as I can get in.</p>
  <p>The purpose of this blog will be to document the progress of these hives. As we go through this adventure, we'll be naming the hives and queens, learning about the specifics of these bees, and all the wonderful things they can do and inspire.</p>
  <p> So these are them!</p>

  <p>In the first row, the first and third hives from the left are our hives! During the transition into our care, we kept them near the center hive while it received its new queen.</p>
  <p>The previous Master overcame his misgivings, and we looked through the hives to find the queens and make sure everyone was healthy and ready for Summer. The central hive, with the red block had recently hatched three new queens. We found the hatched cells, but the new queens were nowhere to be seen. The hive seemed perfectly healthy, but their queen was not set up yet. In the hope that one of them had taken over and was out on her mating flight.</p>
  <p>We decided that until she is able to take over, we would leave the hive in place. So it may be that their hive is incorporated into oursto save them from swarming or suffering from queen loss wherethe females will start growing ovaries and try to assert dominance.</p>
  <p>Which they can't do.</p>
  <p>Because they aren't really capable of producing healthy offspring.</p>
  <p>So for now, the first and third hive are ours, so join us, won't you, as we dive into meeting a few thousand new friends!</p>
