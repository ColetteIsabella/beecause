<h2>Part Two: In Which, We Meet some Drones!</h2>
<hr class="cleanshort">
<p>One of the most fun parts of introducing people to bees for me is the part where I get to prove to them that bees aren't scary. I mean, they <em>are</em> dangerous, especially if you are allergic, and if you make them angry, or scared, they will sting you, but the main thing is, not All of them will sting you at all.</p>

<p>Meet Tony.</p>
<p>Tony is a male bee from one of my hives who witched a ride on my bag when I was leaving the gardens.</p>
<p>Male bees, drones, don't have stingers, they are a little bigger than their sisters, with larger, more doofy eyes, and feet that look a little like they are wearing tiny bee clown shoes.</p>
<p>For a new keeper, it is easy to confuse the queen and a drone, because they have similar size and blunt butts, but there are always quite a few of them, and they are always just miling around eating. Unless they are mating.</p>
<p>In which case, they are out with the queen, flying over flowers and hills, taking turns grabbing hold of the queen and ejecting their genetic material into the queen, at which point, they also jettison their organs and fall to the ground to die.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's pretty rough to be a bee.</p>

<p>This is Arthur. Arthur hitched a ride in my bee suit, just before I had to work for a full weekend so I couldn't take him home. He was covered in honey, and unable to mve, so I gave him a little water, and let him clean himself off.</p>

<p>Once he was clean, he made a point of buzzing me in as intimidating a way possible. But as he had no stinger, and generally promptly fell over after this display, he was hard to take seriously.</p>
<p>Ultimately, poor Arthur passed away after eating far too much honey and water, but before that, I put a slip know on some thread, and managed to acheive a dream I have had for as long as I have loved bees:</p>

<p>RIP Arthur, you were an alarmingly tolerant individual.</p>
