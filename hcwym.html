        <p class="hcwympara">In tarot lore, the Hierophant is the communicator, so I chose an image of a bee doing a dance, which is how they communicate along with pheromones.</p>

        <p class="hcwympara">The Queen is special in a bee colony, only she can lay viable offspring to make more bees. If she gets sickor injured, the whole hive suffers, they get confused, lost and even females who were once infertile can grow ovaries, though their offspring are never viable.</p>

        <p class="hcwympara">The creation of honey is an extremely strange job. Females collect nectar in their second stomach, then return to the hive to regurgitate it into the comb. They then dry the nectar by vibrating their wings, and cover over it with wax to save it for winter</p>
